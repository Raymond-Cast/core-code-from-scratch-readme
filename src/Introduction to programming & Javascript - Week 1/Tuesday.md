## 1. **Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages**

Intepreted and Compiled Programming Languages are the two computer technologies that we can use to convert our 'Source Code' (set of instructions) into 'Machine Code' (what our computers understand and execute) so our programs, applications, etc. can run. Without them, our code wounldn't be able to come to life and it would stay as text only. Both of these Programming Languages have their advantages and disadvantages; however, defining the intended purpose of our Code will make it easire to determine which kind of Programming Language would be preferrable to complete the tasks we need.

### Interpreted Programing Language

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Cross-Platform  | Interpreter required |
| Simpler to test | Often **slower** | 
| Easier to debug | Source Code is **Public** | 

### Compiled Programing Language

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Ready** to run | **NOT** Cross-Platform |
| Often faster (CPU) | Inflexible | 
| Source Code is Public | Compiler required |

## 2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?

 Both. Java is a Hybrid Programming Language, where code in Java is **First Compiled** downt to *bytecode* and then depending on the environment it will be run, it *may* be either **compiled or interpreted** by using the Java Interpreter/JIT Compiler.

## 3. Pseudocode Currency Converter

```
1. START
2. USD <-- GET
3. BTC <-- 0.000044
4. SUM <-- USD * BTC
5. PRINT SUM
6. END

```

## 4. Learn about [High and Low level languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUWCD45qniA)

Low and High Level Programming Languages provide different ways for us, as humans to interact with a computer. Computers operate in a low-level Programming Language and that's why having the means to communicate and interact with them is so important. 

**Low-level Programming Languages** are characterized for having a low-level of abstraction in regards to programming concepts and is very close to interact with the hardware from a computer. Some languages are C and C++. Their benefits are:

1. Directly Executable
2. Complete control over hardware
3. Very efficient
4. Excellent for Operating Systems and Firmwares

However, some of the disadvantages include that they are more difficult to use and its development is usually longer.

**High-level Programming Languages** are currently the most known and used languages by developers, including JavaScript, PHP, C#, etc. They are the closest to a Human Language so interacting with them is easier, as they are usually easier to read, write and maintain.
